\textbf{AIDPMTLF} can learn big data well while protecting the private information as shown in section 4. However, the protection of privacy never stops as attack models arises and develops everday. For the future work, we still consider differential privacy as perspective for multi-task learning problems. Further contribution can be made from: 1) specfic model design for specific datasets. Because each dataset faces different attacks. For example, Netflix Prize dataset is threatened as the existence of public resources from the Internet Movie Database. Financial and medical records all face different information leakage ways. \textbf{AIDPMTLF} disolve the privacy issue in a general case. More specific modication can be made on the basis of it when facing different multi-task learning problems. 2) Noises can be analyzed and used to improve the model. Feedback mechanism may produce promotion. 3) Different network structures may incur unexpected results. We use basic neural networks in this paper. Creative network design is promising for amazing achievement for big data analysis.
