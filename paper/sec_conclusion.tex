In this paper, we highlight the contribution of  multi-task learning on current research of big data analysis. But we also analyze the limitations of it on private datasets. Privacy has been an enduring topic in computer science and appeals a lot of concentration. We introduce differential privacy and emphasize its good performance on privacy-preserving. By combing multi-task learning and differential privacy, we come up with a model called Asynchronous Interactive Distributed Private Multitask Learning Framework with Trustworthy Data Aggregator (AIDPMTLF). Experiments in section 4 reveals its good performance on big data while protecting the data privacy. We further analyze its weakness and discuss the future work.
