Recently, multi-task learning (MTL) has proved to be an powerful learning framework that improves performance in supervised learning problems by transferring knowledge among those tasks. Distributed MTL is one popular setting where the data is separated across different locations. The issue of privacy arises when distributed MTL is applied on geographically separated data. These data are usually personal data such as financial and medical records, which may contain personal sensitive information. In such case, privacy-preserving distributed MTL frameworks are in great need as the proliferation of private data. Differential privacy (DP) is one of the most important privacy concepts that are suitable for this type of framework. In this proposal, we put up with a novel idea: \textbf{A}synchronous \textbf{I}nteractive \textbf{D}istributed \textbf{P}rivate \textbf{M}ultitask \textbf{L}earning \textbf{F}ramework with Trustworthy Data Aggregator (AIDPMTLF) to address the privacy issue under distributed MTL setting. The proposed framework adds carefully designed perturbation on the data aggregator. We also provide theoretical guarantees of the proposed framework and extensive empirical results to illustrate our idea.
